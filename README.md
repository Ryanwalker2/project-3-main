## Usage
The Music E-Store is perfect for artists or musicians who may not be technically skilled, but need an e-store template that allows them to have an online store without having to pay for monthly website hosting fees or give up a percentage of their sales to the website hosting company. Also, this application has a secured way of their customers/fans being able to register their email addresses on file, and the artist will be able to own this data and have the ability to leverage it as marketing emailing list which is not possible with instagram, facebook and other social media platforms.
